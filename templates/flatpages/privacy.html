<h1> Privacy Policy</h1>


<div>
    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>Like most website operators, {{site_name}} collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
        and the
        date and time of each visitor request. {{site_name}}’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
        is to better understand how {{site_name}}’s visitors use its website. From time to time, {{site_name}} may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
        its website.</p>
    <p>{{site_name}} also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
        logged in users and for users leaving reviews/feedback/comments on {{site_domain}} site. {{site_name}} only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>Certain visitors to {{site_name}}’s websites choose to interact with {{site_name}} in ways that require {{site_name}} to
        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that {{site_name}} gathers depends
        on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at <a
            href="{{site_homepage}}">{{site_domain}}</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
        transactions
        with {{site_name}} are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
        information required to process those transactions. In each case, {{site_name}} collects such information only
        insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with {{site_name}}.
        {{site_name}} does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can
        always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
        engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
    <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
    <p>{{site_name}} may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, {{site_name}} does not
        disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>{{site_name}} discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
        its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
        process
        it on {{site_name}}’s behalf or to provide services available at {{site_name}}’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not
        to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
        outside of your home country; by using {{site_name}}’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
        them. {{site_name}} will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
        above, {{site_name}} discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
        response
        to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when {{site_name}} believes in good faith that
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of {{site_name}}, third parties or the public
        at
        large. If you are a registered user of an {{site_name}} website and have supplied your email address, {{site_name}} may
        occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
        date with what’s going on with {{site_name}} and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support
        email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
        respond to your request or to help us support other users. {{site_name}} takes all measures reasonably necessary to
        protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
        and personally-identifying information.</p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
        provides to the website each time the visitor returns. {{site_name}} uses cookies to help {{site_name}} identify and
        track visitors, their usage of {{site_name}} website, and their website access preferences. {{site_name}} visitors who
        do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
        {{site_name}}’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of {{site_name}}’s websites may not function properly
        without the aid of cookies.</p>
    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>If {{site_name}}, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that {{site_name}} goes out
        of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
        by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of {{site_name}} may continue
        to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <h3>Ads</h3>
    <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
        These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
        compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
        other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
        Policy
        covers the use of cookies by {{site_name}} and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, {{site_name}} may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
        {{site_name}}’s sole discretion. {{site_name}} encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
        its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
        acceptance of such change.</p>
